# Gaussian-Mixture-Model
We use Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as a clustering algorithm to segmentate the pixels of a picture, and also we replace value of points of each segment with value of corresponded centroid.  

We can see how this model help us to reduce volume of a picture but still has enough information from original picture to recognize it.  
GMM is a Soft clustering algorithms can cluster data in partially one cluster and partially others.

# Description:  
Image segmentation is the process of segmenting an image into multiple important regions.  
We can use a GMM to segment an image into K regions (n_components = K) according to significant colors.  
Each pixel would be a data point with three features (r, g, b) (Or 1 feature if greyscale).  

# Flow Chart
1. Description
2. Import Libraries
3. Add and Reshape Image (Prepareing Image)
4. Change Image to Black and White
5. Plot clusters of image (6 Components)
6. Use Silhouette score to find best K (For Practice Purpose and Test This Score Metric)
